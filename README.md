# üß† Depression Analyzer using Machine Learning

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of depression in students based on a dataset of behavioral, emotional, and academic indicators.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `app.py` ‚Äì Web application interface (Streamlit or Flask).
- `train.py` ‚Äì Model training script.
- `depression_model.pkl` ‚Äì Trained machine learning model.
- `scaler.pkl` ‚Äì Preprocessing scaler object (used for consistent input transformation).
- `student_depression_dataset.csv` ‚Äì Dataset used for training the model.

## üìä Dataset

The model is trained on `student_depression_dataset.csv`, which contains anonymized data on student behavior, academic performance, and mental health indicators.  
The dataset is preprocessed and scaled before training to ensure consistency and performance.
